* Call: To submit an action to the EOS Blockchain `chain_id`.

* Authorizations & Permissions: Permissions are arbitrary names used to define the requirements for a transaction sent on behalf of that permission. Permissions can be assigned for authority over specific contract actions.

* Ricardian Contract: A contract that places the defining elements of a legal agreement in a format that can be expressed and executed in software.

# Article I -  User Acknowledgement of Risks 
If User loses access to their EOS account on `chain_id` and has not taken appropriate measures to secure access to their EOS account by other means, the User acknowledges and agrees that that EOS account will become inaccessible. Users acknowledge that the User has an adequate understanding of the risks, usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens and blockchain-based software. The User acknowledges and agrees that the User is using the EOS blockchain at their sole risk.

# Article II - Special User Types
Users who call `regproducer` agree to, and are bound by, the *regproducer* Ricardian Contract.

# Article III - Consent of the EUA
The nature of the *EOS User Agreement* is such that it serves as a description of the current EOS Mainnet governance functions that are in place. These functions, enforced by code, do not require the consent of Users as these functions are inherent and systemic to the EOS Mainnet itself.

# Article IV - Governing Documents
Any modifications to the *EUA* and *governing documents* may be made by `eosio.prods`. It is admonished that a statement be crafted and issued through `eosio.prods` via eosio.forum referendum contract describing such a modification in advance.

# Article VII - Network Funds
It is admonished that any altering of the state of any tokens contained within network fund accounts, or altering any pre-existing code that directly or indirectly governs the allocation, fulfillment, or distribution of any *network funds* be preceded by a statement crafted and issued by `eosio.prods` to the *eosio.forum* referendum system contract describing the effect in advance.

# Article VIII - Freedom of Account Creation
Any current or future User is able to create an EOS Account without the permission by any other User. `eosio.prods` may never affect an EOS User Account(s) without valid permission(s) which have been shared with `eosio.prods` by an EOS account. `eosio.prods` may charge a fee for any actions that are requested by other Users pertaining to an EOS account where permissions are shared.
